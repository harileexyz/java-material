### **1. What is an Exception? The Problem We're Solving**

In an ideal world, our code would always run perfectly. In the real world, things go wrong.
*   A user might enter text where a number is expected.
*   A file you're trying to read might not exist.
*   A network connection might be lost during a data transfer.

An **exception** is an unwanted or unexpected event that occurs during the execution of a program, disrupting the normal flow of instructions. If not handled, an exception will terminate the program and print a "stack trace" to the console, which is often confusing for a user.

**Java's Exception Handling mechanism** provides a structured, robust, and object-oriented way to deal with these errors. Instead of crashing, your program can "catch" the error, handle it gracefully (e.g., by showing a friendly error message), and either continue running or terminate in a controlled manner.

**Analogy: A Chef in a Kitchen**
*   **Normal Flow:** The chef follows a recipe step-by-step.
*   **Exception:** The chef reaches for an egg, but the carton is empty.
    *   **No Exception Handling (Crashing):** The chef panics, throws everything on the floor, and shuts down the kitchen. The customer gets no food.
    *   **With Exception Handling:** The chef is trained for this. He **`try`**-s to get an egg. He **`catch`**-es the "Empty Carton" exception. His handling logic is to politely inform the customer, "We are out of eggs, would you like to order something else?" The kitchen continues to operate.

### **2. The Exception Hierarchy**

In Java, exceptions are objects that inherit from the `java.lang.Throwable` class. This class is the root of the entire exception hierarchy.

*   **`java.lang.Throwable`**: The superclass of all errors and exceptions.
    *   **`java.lang.Error`**: Represents serious, abnormal problems that are generally not recoverable by the application (e.g., `OutOfMemoryError`, `StackOverflowError`). You typically **should not** try to catch these.
    *   **`java.lang.Exception`**: Represents exceptional conditions that a well-written application **should** anticipate and handle. This is where we focus our attention.
        *   **Checked Exceptions**: Subclasses of `Exception` (but not `RuntimeException`).
        *   **Unchecked Exceptions**: Subclasses of `RuntimeException`.



---

### **3. Types of Exceptions: Checked vs. Unchecked**

This is a key distinction in Java's exception handling philosophy.

#### **a) Checked Exceptions**

*   **Definition:** These are exceptions that a well-written application should anticipate and recover from. They represent exceptional conditions in external resources (e.g., file system, network).
*   **Compiler's Role:** The Java compiler **checks at compile-time** that you are handling these exceptions. You are *forced* to deal with them.
*   **How to Handle:** You must either:
    1.  Wrap the code that can throw the exception in a `try-catch` block.
    2.  Declare that your method `throws` the exception, passing the responsibility to the calling method.
*   **Examples:** `IOException` (file not found), `SQLException` (database error), `ClassNotFoundException`.

#### **b) Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions)**

*   **Definition:** These are exceptions that typically result from **programming errors** or bugs in your code, such as logic errors or improper use of an API.
*   **Compiler's Role:** The compiler **does not** check if you handle these. It's assumed you should fix the underlying code rather than catch the exception.
*   **How to Handle:** You *can* use `try-catch`, but it's often better to fix the code that's causing the problem (e.g., by adding a `null` check).
*   **Examples:** `NullPointerException` (accessing a method on a `null` reference), `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` (using an invalid array index), `ArithmeticException` (e.g., division by zero), `IllegalArgumentException`.

---

### **4. Core Keywords for Handling Exceptions**

#### **a) `try` and `catch`: The Safety Net**

*   **`try` block:** You place the "risky" code—the code that might throw an exception—inside the `try` block.
*   **`catch` block:** This block is the "handler." It is executed only if an exception of the specified type occurs within the `try` block. It takes the exception object as a parameter.

**Program Example: Handling a Potential `ArithmeticException`**
```java
public class TryCatchDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Risky operation: Division by zero
            System.out.println("Attempting to divide...");
            int result = 10 / 0; // This line will throw an ArithmeticException
            System.out.println("This will never be printed."); // Skipped
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            // This block executes because an ArithmeticException was thrown.
            System.out.println("An error occurred!");
            System.out.println("Error message: You cannot divide by zero.");
            // e.printStackTrace(); // Useful for debugging to see the full error stack
        }
        
        System.out.println("Program continues to run after handling the exception.");
    }
}
```

#### **b) Multiple `catch` Clauses: Handling Different Problems**

A single `try` block can be followed by multiple `catch` clauses to handle different types of exceptions. The `catch` blocks are checked in order, and the **first one that matches** the exception type is executed.

**Rule:** You must order your `catch` blocks from the **most specific to the most general** exception type. If you put `catch (Exception e)` first, it will catch everything, and more specific catch blocks below it will be unreachable, causing a compile error.

**Program Example:**
```java
public class MultipleCatchDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
            // numbers[5] = 10 / 0; // Change this line to test different exceptions

            // Test 1: Access an invalid index
            System.out.println(numbers[5]); 
            
            // Test 2: Divide by zero
            // int result = 10 / 0;

        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            // This block is specific to array index errors.
            System.out.println("Error: Invalid array index used.");
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            // This block is specific to arithmetic errors.
            System.out.println("Error: Cannot perform the arithmetic operation.");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // A general "catch-all" block for any other exceptions.
            System.out.println("An unexpected error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

#### **c) Nested `try` Statements**
You can have a `try-catch` block inside another `try` block. This is useful when a block of code might cause one type of error, and a specific part of that block might cause another, more specific error that you want to handle differently.

#### **d) `finally`: The "Always Execute" Block**

*   **Definition:** The `finally` block is an optional block that is **guaranteed to be executed** after the `try` block finishes, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not.
*   **When to use it:** It is the perfect place to put **cleanup code**, such as closing a file, releasing a network connection, or closing a database connection. This ensures that critical resources are always released.

**Program Example: Demonstrating `finally`**
```java
public class FinallyDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside the try block.");
            // int result = 10 / 0; // Uncomment this line to see it still runs 'finally'
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Inside the catch block.");
        } finally {
            // This code will run whether an exception occurred or not.
            System.out.println("Inside the finally block. This ALWAYS runs for cleanup.");
        }
        System.out.println("Program continues...");
    }
}
```

### **5. Generating Exceptions: `throw` and `throws`**

#### **a) `throw`: Manually Throwing an Exception**

The `throw` keyword is used to **explicitly throw an exception** from a method or block of code. You can throw built-in exceptions or your own custom exceptions. This is useful when your code detects a situation that is an error according to your business logic.

**Program Example: Validating Age**
```java
public class AgeValidator {
    public static void validate(int age) {
        if (age < 18) {
            // Manually create and throw an exception object.
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age must be 18 or older to vote.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Welcome! You are eligible to vote.");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            validate(15);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            System.out.println("Validation failed: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

#### **b) `throws`: Declaring Exceptions a Method Might Throw**

The `throws` keyword is used in a method signature to declare the types of **checked exceptions** that the method might throw but does not handle itself. It essentially "passes the buck," forcing the calling method to handle the exception.

**Program Example: Reading a File**
`IOException` is a checked exception. The `readFile` method doesn't want to handle it, so it declares that it `throws` it.

```java
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ThrowsDemo {
    // This method declares that it can throw an IOException.
    public static void readFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
        FileReader reader = new FileReader(fileName);
        // ... code to read the file ...
        System.out.println("File read successfully (hypothetically).");
        reader.close();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Because readFile() 'throws' IOException, the main method MUST handle it.
        try {
            readFile("non_existent_file.txt");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error in main: Could not read the file.");
            System.out.println("Details: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **6. Common Built-in Exceptions**
*   `NullPointerException`: Trying to access a member of a `null` object.
*   `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`: Using an illegal index to access an array.
*   `ArithmeticException`: An exceptional arithmetic condition, like integer division by zero.
*   `NumberFormatException`: Trying to convert a string to a numeric type, but the string is not a valid number.
*   `IOException`: An error occurred during an I/O (Input/Output) operation.
*   `FileNotFoundException`: A subclass of `IOException`, specifically for when a file cannot be found.
*   `IllegalArgumentException`: Passed an illegal or inappropriate argument to a method.

---

### **7. Creating Custom Exceptions**

You can create your own exception classes to represent errors specific to your application's logic. This makes your code more readable and your error handling more specific.

**How to do it:**
1.  Create a new class that `extends` either `Exception` (for a checked exception) or `RuntimeException` (for an unchecked exception).
2.  It's good practice to provide a constructor that accepts a `String` message and passes it to the superclass's constructor using `super(message)`.

**Program Example: A Custom Banking Exception**
```java
// 1. Create a custom checked exception.
class InsufficientFundsException extends Exception {
    public InsufficientFundsException(String message) {
        // Pass the message to the parent Exception class.
        super(message);
    }
}

// A bank account class that uses the custom exception.
class BankAccount {
    private double balance;
    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) { this.balance = initialBalance; }

    public void withdraw(double amount) throws InsufficientFundsException {
        if (amount > balance) {
            // Throw our custom exception.
            throw new InsufficientFundsException("Withdrawal amount of " + amount + " exceeds current balance of " + balance);
        }
        balance -= amount;
        System.out.println("Withdrawal successful. New balance: " + balance);
    }
}

// Main class to test it.
public class CustomExceptionDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount myAccount = new BankAccount(5000);
        try {
            System.out.println("Attempting to withdraw 6000...");
            myAccount.withdraw(6000);
        } catch (InsufficientFundsException e) {
            System.out.println("Transaction Failed!");
            System.out.println("Reason: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

## **✍️ Exception Handling Worksheet**

### **Part A: Theory Questions**
1. What is the difference between an `Error` and an `Exception` in Java?
2. Explain the difference between a Checked and an Unchecked Exception. Give one example of each.
3. What is the primary purpose of the `finally` block? When is it guaranteed to execute?
4. What is the difference between the `throw` and `throws` keywords?
5. Why would you create a custom exception instead of just using a standard one like `IllegalArgumentException`?

### **Part B: Code Writing and Analysis**

**❓ Q1. Handle Multiple Exceptions**
Write a program that prompts a user to enter two numbers from the console (as strings). Convert these strings to integers and print their division (`num1 / num2`). Your program must handle two potential exceptions:
*   `NumberFormatException`: If the user enters non-numeric input.
*   `ArithmeticException`: If the second number is `0`.
In both cases, print a user-friendly error message. Add a `finally` block to print "Program finished."

**❓ Q2. Custom Exception**
Create a custom unchecked exception called `InvalidPasswordException`. Then, create a `UserLogin` class with a method `login(String password)`. This method should check if the password is less than 8 characters long. If it is, it should `throw` a new `InvalidPasswordException` with the message "Password must be at least 8 characters long." In your `main` method, call this `login` method inside a `try-catch` block and handle the custom exception.

## **✅ Solutions to Worksheet**

### **Part A: Theory - Solutions**

1.  An `Error` represents a serious, unrecoverable system-level problem (like running out of memory), and applications are not expected to handle them. An `Exception` represents a recoverable problem (like a file not being found) that applications should handle.
2.  **Checked Exception:** An exception the compiler forces you to handle (with `try-catch` or `throws`). Example: `IOException`. **Unchecked Exception:** An exception the compiler does not force you to handle, usually caused by a programming bug. Example: `NullPointerException`.
3.  The `finally` block's primary purpose is for cleanup code (like closing files or database connections). It is guaranteed to execute after the `try` block, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught.
4.  `throw` is a statement used to *manually throw* an exception object. `throws` is a keyword used in a *method signature* to declare that the method might throw certain checked exceptions, delegating the handling responsibility to the caller.
5.  You create a custom exception to make your code more readable and your error handling more specific. `InsufficientFundsException` is much more descriptive and meaningful in a banking application than a generic `IllegalArgumentException`.

### **Part B: Code - Solutions**

**❓ Q1. Handle Multiple Exceptions - Solution**
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class DivisionHandler {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        try {
            System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
            String input1 = scanner.nextLine();
            int num1 = Integer.parseInt(input1);

            System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
            String input2 = scanner.nextLine();
            int num2 = Integer.parseInt(input2);

            int result = num1 / num2;
            System.out.println("Result of division: " + result);

        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Please enter valid integers only.");
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Cannot divide by zero.");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Program finished.");
            scanner.close();
        }
    }
}
```

**❓ Q2. Custom Exception - Solution**
```java
// 1. Create the custom exception (extends RuntimeException for unchecked)
class InvalidPasswordException extends RuntimeException {
    public InvalidPasswordException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

// 2. Create the class that uses the exception
class UserLogin {
    public void login(String password) {
        if (password == null || password.length() < 8) {
            // Throw the custom exception if the rule is violated
            throw new InvalidPasswordException("Password must be at least 8 characters long.");
        }
        System.out.println("Login successful!");
    }
}

// 3. Main class to test the logic
public class LoginTester {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UserLogin user = new UserLogin();
        try {
            System.out.println("Attempting login with a short password...");
            user.login("pass"); // This will throw the exception
        } catch (InvalidPasswordException e) {
            System.out.println("Login Failed! Reason: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        
        System.out.println("\nAttempting login with a valid password...");
        try {
            user.login("password123");
        } catch (InvalidPasswordException e) {
            System.out.println("This should not happen.");
        }
    }
}
```
