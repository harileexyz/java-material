## **Quick Revision Guide: JDBC Fundamentals**

This guide provides short, precise definitions and code examples for key JDBC concepts, ideal for exam preparation.

### **1. JDBC Overview**

*   **Definition:** JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a standard **Java API** used to perform database operations from a Java application. It provides a set of classes and interfaces that allow for a uniform way to connect to and interact with various relational databases (like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL).
*   **Analogy:** JDBC is a **universal adapter**. The Java application has a standard plug (the JDBC API). Each database provider (MySQL, Oracle) creates a special socket for that plug (the **JDBC Driver**). As long as you have the right adapter (driver), your standard plug (Java code) can connect to any socket (database).

### **2. JDBC Driver Types**

There are four types of JDBC drivers, though Types 2 and 4 are the most relevant today.

*   **Type 1: JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver:** Translates JDBC calls into ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) calls. (Largely obsolete).
*   **Type 2: Native-API Driver:** A mix of Java code and native code (C/C++). It translates JDBC calls into calls on the client-side API of the database. Requires native libraries to be installed on the client machine.
*   **Type 3: Network-Protocol Driver:** A pure Java driver that communicates with a middleware server, which then translates the requests into the database-specific protocol.
*   **Type 4: Thin Driver (Database-Protocol Driver):** A **pure Java** driver that communicates directly with the database server using its native protocol. This is the **most common and recommended type** because it is platform-independent and does not require any special software on the client side. The MySQL Connector/J is a Type 4 driver.

### **3. The 6 Steps to Perform a JDBC Operation**

This is a very common exam question.

1.  **Load and Register the Driver:** (Often automatic in modern JDBC 4.0+) Tell the `DriverManager` which driver to use.
    *   `Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");`
2.  **Establish a Connection:** Create a `Connection` object using the database URL, username, and password.
    *   `Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, pass);`
3.  **Create a Statement:** Create a `Statement` or `PreparedStatement` object to execute SQL queries.
    *   `PreparedStatement pstmt = con.prepareStatement(sql);`
4.  **Execute the Query:** Run the SQL query. The method you call depends on the type of query.
    *   `ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();` (for `SELECT`)
    *   `int rowsAffected = pstmt.executeUpdate();` (for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)
5.  **Process the Results:** If you executed a `SELECT` query, iterate through the `ResultSet` object to retrieve the data.
    *   `while (rs.next()) { ... }`
6.  **Close the Resources:** **Crucially**, close the `ResultSet`, `Statement`, and `Connection` objects to release database and memory resources. This is best done with a `try-with-resources` statement or in a `finally` block.

### **4. Common JDBC Components**

*   **`DriverManager`:** A factory class that manages a set of JDBC drivers. Its primary role is to provide a `Connection` to the database via its `getConnection()` method.

*   **`Connection`:** An interface representing a single session with the database. It's the context within which all SQL statements are executed and results are returned.

*   **`Statement` vs. `PreparedStatement`:**
    *   **`Statement`:** Used for executing simple, static SQL queries. It is vulnerable to **SQL Injection** attacks.
        ```java
        Statement stmt = con.createStatement();
        ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + userId); // UNSAFE!
        ```
    *   **`PreparedStatement`:** Used for executing pre-compiled SQL queries with parameters (`?`). It is **safer** (prevents SQL injection) and often performs better. **This is the preferred choice.**
        ```java
        PreparedStatement pstmt = con.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?");
        pstmt.setInt(1, userId); // Safely sets the parameter
        ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
        ```

*   **`ResultSet`:** An interface representing the data returned from a `SELECT` query. It's like a cursor pointing to one row of data at a time. You use its `next()` method to move to the next row.

### **5. Connection Establishment**

*   **Definition:** This is the process of creating a `Connection` object. It requires a **JDBC URL**, which is a specially formatted string that tells the `DriverManager` which driver to use and which database to connect to.
*   **JDBC URL Format:** It always follows the pattern `jdbc:<subprotocol>:<subname>`.
    *   **MySQL Example:** `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase`
        *   `jdbc`: The standard protocol.
        *   `mysql`: The subprotocol for the MySQL driver.
        *   `//localhost:3306/mydatabase`: The subname, containing the host, port, and database name.
*   **Code Example:**
    ```java
    String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/login_app_db";
    String user = "root";
    String password = "password";
    try {
        Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
        System.out.println("Connection established successfully!");
        connection.close();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        System.err.println("Connection failed: " + e.getMessage());
    }
    ```

### **6. SQL Fundamentals & CRUD Operations with JDBC**

**CRUD** stands for **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete. These are the four basic functions of persistent storage.

#### **a) READ (Executing `SELECT` Queries and Working with `ResultSet`)**

This operation retrieves data from the database.

*   **`executeQuery()`:** This method is used for `SELECT` statements and returns a `ResultSet` object.
*   **Working with `ResultSet`:**
    *   `rs.next()`: Moves the cursor to the next row. It returns `false` when there are no more rows. This is typically used as the condition in a `while` loop.
    *   `rs.getString("column_name")`, `rs.getInt("column_name")`: These "getter" methods retrieve the value from a specific column in the current row.

*   **Code Example:**
    ```java
    // Assume 'con' is a valid Connection object
    String sql = "SELECT id, username FROM users WHERE username = ?";
    try (PreparedStatement pstmt = con.prepareStatement(sql)) {
        pstmt.setString(1, "btech");
        try (ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery()) {
            // Check if any result was found
            if (rs.next()) {
                int id = rs.getInt("id");
                String username = rs.getString("username");
                System.out.println("User found: ID=" + id + ", Username=" + username);
            } else {
                System.out.println("User not found.");
            }
        }
    }
    ```

#### **b) CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE (Using `executeUpdate()`)**

These operations modify data in the database.

*   **`executeUpdate()`:** This method is used for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements. It does **not** return a `ResultSet`. Instead, it returns an `int` representing the **number of rows affected** by the query.

**Code Example: CREATE (`INSERT`)**
```java
String sql = "INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?, ?)";
try (PreparedStatement pstmt = con.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    pstmt.setString(1, "student");
    pstmt.setString(2, "1234");
    
    int rowsAffected = pstmt.executeUpdate();
    System.out.println(rowsAffected + " row(s) inserted."); // Should print "1 row(s) inserted."
}
```

**Code Example: UPDATE**
```java
String sql = "UPDATE users SET password = ? WHERE username = ?";
try (PreparedStatement pstmt = con.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    pstmt.setString(1, "new_password_5678");
    pstmt.setString(2, "student");
    
    int rowsAffected = pstmt.executeUpdate();
    System.out.println(rowsAffected + " row(s) updated.");
}
```

**Code Example: DELETE**
```java
String sql = "DELETE FROM users WHERE username = ?";
try (PreparedStatement pstmt = con.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    pstmt.setString(1, "student");
    
    int rowsAffected = pstmt.executeUpdate();
    System.out.println(rowsAffected + " row(s) deleted.");
}
```
