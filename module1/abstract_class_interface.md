Of course. You're right, jumping straight to `abstract class` without first solidifying the concept of a regular `class` can be confusing. Let's restructure that section to introduce classes first, then build upon that knowledge to explain abstract classes and interfaces.

Here is the revised, more pedagogical flow for that part of your study material.

### **Module 4: The Pillars of OOP - Classes, Abstract Classes & Interfaces**

This module introduces the core building blocks of Object-Oriented design in Java. We will start with the most fundamental unit—the **class**—and then explore its specialized forms: abstract classes and interfaces.

### **1. The Class: The Blueprint of OOP**

#### **1.1. Detailed Description: Classes and Objects**

In the real world, we are surrounded by objects: a car, a phone, a student, a bank account. Each of these objects has two key characteristics:
1.  **State:** The data or attributes that describe it (a car has a *color*, a *model*, and a *current speed*).
2.  **Behavior:** The actions it can perform (a car can *start*, *accelerate*, and *brake*).

In Object-Oriented Programming, a **class** is a blueprint or template that defines the common structure for a type of object. It specifies what attributes (state) its objects will have and what methods (behavior) they can perform.

An **object** (also called an **instance**) is a concrete entity created from that class blueprint. It exists in memory and has its own specific values for its attributes.

*   **Class:** The architectural blueprint for a house. It defines that a house will have rooms, doors, and windows.
*   **Object:** An actual, physical house built from that blueprint. Your house and your neighbor's house are two different objects built from the same blueprint; each has its own address and color.

#### **1.2. How to Define a Class in Java**

A class definition bundles fields (variables for state) and methods (functions for behavior).

> **Naming Convention:** Class names should always start with a capital letter and use `PascalCase` (e.g., `BankAccount`, `StudentDetails`).

**Program Example: The `Car` Class**
Let's build a simple `Car` class to model this.

```java
// File: Car.java
public class Car {
    // --- 1. Fields (Attributes) - Define the STATE of a Car ---
    // These are instance variables; each Car object gets its own copy.
    String model;
    String color;
    int year;
    double currentSpeed;

    // --- 2. Methods (Behaviors) - Define what a Car CAN DO ---
    // These methods will operate on the fields of a specific Car object.
    public void accelerate(double amount) {
        this.currentSpeed += amount;
        System.out.println("The " + this.color + " " + this.model + " is now moving at " + this.currentSpeed + " km/h.");
    }

    public void brake() {
        this.currentSpeed = 0;
        System.out.println("The " + this.model + " has stopped.");
    }

    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("--- Car Details ---");
        System.out.println("Model: " + this.model);
        System.out.println("Color: " + this.color);
        System.out.println("Year: " + this.year);
        System.out.println("-------------------");
    }
}
```

#### **1.3. Creating and Using Objects**

Once you have the class (the blueprint), you can create objects (the actual cars) using the `new` keyword.

**The `new` keyword does three things:**
1.  **Allocates Memory:** It reserves space in the computer's heap memory for the new object.
2.  **Runs Constructor:** It calls the class's constructor to initialize the object's fields. (More on constructors later).
3.  **Returns a Reference:** It gives you back a memory address (a reference) that points to the new object.

**Program Example: The `Garage` (The Main Class)**

```java
// File: Garage.java
public class Garage {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // --- Creating Objects (Instances) of the Car class ---

        // 1. Declare a reference variable 'car1' of type Car.
        // 2. Use 'new Car()' to create a new Car object in memory.
        // 3. Assign the object's reference to the 'car1' variable.
        Car car1 = new Car();

        // --- Setting the STATE of the car1 object ---
        car1.model = "Honda Civic";
        car1.color = "Red";
        car1.year = 2022;

        // Create a second, completely separate Car object
        Car car2 = new Car();
        car2.model = "Ford Mustang";
        car2.color = "Black";
        car2.year = 2023;

        // --- Calling the BEHAVIORS (methods) on the objects ---
        System.out.println("Displaying initial car details:");
        car1.displayDetails();
        car2.displayDetails();

        System.out.println("\n--- Driving the cars ---");
        // This 'accelerate' call only affects the car1 object
        car1.accelerate(60);
        
        // This 'accelerate' call only affects the car2 object
        car2.accelerate(100);
        
        car1.brake();
    }
}
```
This fundamental concept of bundling data and methods into a single `class` is the foundation upon which all other OOP principles are built.

### **2. Abstract Classes: The Incomplete Blueprint**

Now that we understand a class is a blueprint, imagine a blueprint that is intentionally left incomplete. That's an **abstract class**.

#### **2.1. Detailed Description**

An abstract class is a special type of class that **cannot be used to create objects** (`new AbstractClass()` is illegal). It serves as a common base or template for a family of related subclasses.

It's a blend of specification and implementation:
*   It can have **concrete methods** (regular methods with a full implementation) to provide shared functionality to all its children.
*   It can have **abstract methods** (methods with no body, just a signature) to force its children to provide their own unique implementation for that behavior.

It enforces an **"is-a"** relationship. A `Dog` *is an* `Animal`. A `CreditCardPayment` *is a* `PaymentMethod`.

*   **When to use it?** When you have a group of related classes that share some common code, but each needs to behave differently in specific ways.

#### **2.2. The `abstract` Keyword**

*   To declare a class as abstract, use `public abstract class ClassName`.
*   To declare a method as abstract, use `public abstract returnType methodName();` (note the semicolon and lack of `{}`).

#### **2.3. Program Example: The `PaymentMethod` Hierarchy**

(The `PaymentMethod` example from the previous response is perfect here. It flows naturally from the introduction of classes and provides a clear use case.)

```java
// File: PaymentMethod.java
public abstract class PaymentMethod {
    protected double amount;

    public void setAmount(double amount) {
        this.amount = amount;
    }

    // A concrete method shared by all subclasses
    public void validate() {
        System.out.println("Validating payment for amount: " + amount);
    }

    // An abstract method - subclasses MUST implement this
    public abstract void processPayment();
}

// Concrete subclasses like CreditCardPayment and UpiPayment would follow...
```
*(The rest of the `PaymentMethod` example and the `ECommerceSite` main class would be included here as before.)*

---

### **3. Interfaces: The Pure Contract**

If an abstract class is an *incomplete blueprint*, an interface is a *pure contract* or a *list of rules*. It doesn't provide any blueprint at all; it just specifies what an object **must be able to do**.

#### **3.1. Detailed Description**

An interface defines a set of abstract methods. Any class that claims to **implement** this interface must provide a concrete implementation for **all** of its methods.

It defines a **"can-do"** relationship or a capability. It doesn't care *what* an object is, only what it can do.
*   A `Bird` can fly.
*   An `Airplane` can fly.
*   A `Superhero` can fly.

These three classes are completely unrelated in terms of inheritance (`Airplane` does not extend `Bird`), but they all share the `Flyable` capability. An interface allows us to treat them all as "things that can fly."

#### **3.2. The `interface` and `implements` Keywords**

*   To define an interface: `public interface InterfaceName`.
*   To make a class adhere to the contract: `public class MyClass implements InterfaceName`.
*   A class can `extends` only **one** superclass, but it can `implements` **multiple** interfaces. This is how Java achieves a form of multiple inheritance.

#### **3.3. Program Example: The `NotificationService` Contract**

(The `NotificationService` example is an excellent illustration of this concept and fits perfectly here.)

```java
// File: NotificationService.java
public interface NotificationService {
    // All methods in an interface are public and abstract by default
    void sendNotification(String recipient, String message);
}

// Concrete implementations like EmailService and SmsService would follow...
```
*(The rest of the `NotificationService` example and the `Application` main class would be included here as before.)*
