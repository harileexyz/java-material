### **1. The Java Ecosystem: The Tools of the Trade**

Before writing code, it's essential to understand the environment where Java programs are created and executed. This ecosystem is what gives Java its famous "Write Once, Run Anywhere" capability.

#### **1.1. Java Programming Environment vs. Runtime Environment**

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** This is the **Programming Environment**. It's the complete toolkit for **developers**. If you want to *write* Java code, you need the JDK.
    *   **Analogy:** A full-fledged car manufacturing factory. It has all the tools, machinery, and raw materials needed to build a car from scratch.
    *   **Includes:** The JRE, the compiler (`javac`), a debugger (`jdb`), and other development tools.

*   **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** This is the **Runtime Environment**. It provides the minimum requirements to **run** a pre-compiled Java application. If you only want to *use* a Java program, you only need the JRE.
    *   **Analogy:** The car itself, along with its engine and fuel. It has everything needed to *run*, but you can't use it to build another car.
    *   **Includes:** The JVM and the core Java libraries (the "Java API").

**The Relationship:** `JDK contains JRE, which in turn contains JVM.`
`Developer needs JDK` → `User needs JRE`

#### **1.2. The Java Compiler (`javac`)**

The Java Compiler is a program (found in the JDK) that takes your human-readable source code (a `.java` file) and translates it into a highly optimized, intermediate language called **Java Bytecode**.

*   **Input:** `MyProgram.java` (Source Code)
*   **Tool:** `javac`
*   **Output:** `MyProgram.class` (Bytecode)

This bytecode is not machine code for Windows or macOS. It's a universal language designed to be understood by only one thing: the Java Virtual Machine.

#### **1.3. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM): The Heart of Java**

The JVM is the magic component that makes Java platform-independent. It is a "virtual" computer that runs inside your actual operating system.

*   **Its Job:** To take the platform-neutral bytecode (`.class` file) and translate it into native machine code that your specific computer's processor can understand and execute.
*   **How it achieves "Write Once, Run Anywhere":** You can take the same `.class` file and run it on any device that has a JVM installed. The Windows JVM translates the bytecode to Windows machine code. The macOS JVM translates the *same* bytecode to macOS machine code. You write the code once, and the JVM handles the platform-specific translation.

**The Full Process:**
`Code (.java)` → `[javac Compiler]` → `Bytecode (.class)` → `[JVM]` → `Native Machine Code` → `Execution`

### **2. Structure of a Simple Java Program**

Every standalone Java application must have a specific structure to be executable.

```java
// This is a single-line comment.

/*
 * This is a multi-line comment. It's good practice to add these
 * to explain what the class does.
 */

// Every executable Java program must have at least one public class.
// The public class name MUST match the file name (e.g., HelloWorld.java).
public class HelloWorld {

    // This is the main method. It is the entry point of the program.
    // The JVM looks for this exact signature to start execution.
    // - public: So it can be called from outside the class by the JVM.
    // - static: So it can be run without creating an object of the HelloWorld class.
    // - void: The method doesn't return any value.
    // - main: The name of the method.
    // - String[] args: A parameter to receive command-line arguments.
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // System.out.println() is a command to print a line of text to the console.
        System.out.println("Hello, B.Tech Students! Welcome to Java.");
        
    } // End of the main method
    
} // End of the HelloWorld class
```

**How to Run from the Command Line:**
1.  Save the code as `HelloWorld.java`.
2.  Open a terminal/command prompt.
3.  Compile the code: `javac HelloWorld.java`
4.  Run the program: `java HelloWorld`

### **3. Primitive Data Types: The Basic Building Blocks**

Primitive types are the most fundamental data types in Java. They are not objects and store simple values directly in memory. Java has 8 primitive types.

| Category  | Data Type | Size      | Description                               | Example Declaration               |
| :-------- | :-------- | :-------- | :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| **Integer** | `byte`    | 1 byte    | Stores small whole numbers (-128 to 127)  | `byte age = 25;`                  |
|           | `short`   | 2 bytes   | Stores whole numbers (-32,768 to 32,767) | `short year = 2023;`              |
|           | `int`     | 4 bytes   | The most common type for whole numbers. | `int salary = 90000;`             |
|           | `long`    | 8 bytes   | For very large whole numbers.             | `long population = 8000000000L;`  |
| **Floating-Point** | `float`   | 4 bytes   | For fractional numbers (single-precision). | `float price = 199.99f;`            |
|           | `double`  | 8 bytes   | For more precise fractional numbers (double-precision). | `double pi = 3.1415926535;`       |
| **Character** | `char`    | 2 bytes   | Stores a single Unicode character.      | `char grade = 'A';`               |
| **Boolean** | `boolean` | 1 bit     | Stores only `true` or `false` values.     | `boolean isLoggedIn = true;`      |

*Note: The `L` suffix for `long` and `f` for `float` are important to tell the compiler to treat the literal value as that specific type.*

### **4. Wrapper Types, Casting, and Autoboxing**

#### **Wrapper Types**
For every primitive type, Java provides a corresponding **class** called a Wrapper class. These classes "wrap" a primitive value inside an object.

*   **Why are they needed?** The Java Collections Framework (like `ArrayList`, `HashMap`) can only store objects, not primitives. Wrapper classes bridge this gap.
*   **Examples:** `int` → `Integer`, `double` → `Double`, `char` → `Character`, `boolean` → `Boolean`.

#### **Casting: Converting Between Types**
Casting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another.

*   **Widening Casting (Implicit/Automatic):** Converting a smaller type to a larger type size. This is safe and done automatically by Java.
    ```java
    int myInt = 100;
    double myDouble = myInt; // int is automatically widened to double
    System.out.println(myDouble); // Output: 100.0
    ```
*   **Narrowing Casting (Explicit/Manual):** Converting a larger type to a smaller type size. This is risky as it can lead to data loss. You must do it explicitly by putting the target type in parentheses.
    ```java
    double myDouble = 99.98;
    int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Manually cast double to int
    System.out.println(myInt); // Output: 99 (the .98 is lost)
    ```

#### **Autoboxing and Unboxing**
This is a convenience feature where Java automatically converts between primitive types and their corresponding Wrapper objects.

*   **Autoboxing:** Primitive → Wrapper Object.
    ```java
    Integer myInteger = 50; // Autoboxing: Java is secretly doing Integer.valueOf(50);
    ```
*   **Unboxing:** Wrapper Object → Primitive.
    ```java
    int myInt = myInteger; // Unboxing: Java is secretly doing myInteger.intValue();
    ```

### **5. Essential Data Structures: Arrays, Strings, and Vectors**

#### **Arrays**
*   **Definition:** An array is a fixed-size container object that holds a specific number of elements of the **same data type**. The size of an array is established when it is created and cannot be changed.
*   **Analogy:** An egg carton. It has a fixed number of slots (e.g., 12), and you can only put eggs (same type) in it.
*   **Indexing:** Elements are accessed via a zero-based index (`array[0]`, `array[1]`, etc.).

**Program Example:**
```java
public class ArrayDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declare and initialize an array of strings
        String[] subjects = {"Java", "Data Structures", "Algorithms", "Databases"};

        // Access an element
        System.out.println("The first subject is: " + subjects[0]); // Output: Java

        // Iterate through the array using an enhanced for loop
        System.out.println("\nAll Subjects:");
        for (String subject : subjects) {
            System.out.println("- " + subject);
        }

        // Get the size of the array
        System.out.println("\nTotal number of subjects: " + subjects.length); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

#### **Strings**
*   **Definition:** In Java, a `String` is an object that represents a sequence of characters. Unlike in some other languages, strings are not primitive types.
*   **Key Property: Immutability.** This is a crucial concept. Once a `String` object is created, its value **cannot be changed**. Any method that appears to modify a string (like `toUpperCase()` or `replace()`) actually creates and returns a **new** `String` object with the modification. The original string remains untouched.

**Program Example:**
```java
public class StringDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String greeting = "Hello, World!";
        
        System.out.println("Original String: " + greeting);
        
        // toUpperCase() does NOT change the original string.
        // It returns a NEW string.
        String upperGreeting = greeting.toUpperCase();
        
        System.out.println("After toUpperCase(): " + upperGreeting);
        System.out.println("Original string is still unchanged: " + greeting);
    }
}
```

#### **Vector Class**
*   **Definition:** A `Vector` is a **dynamic array**. Unlike a standard array, a `Vector` can grow and shrink in size as needed. It belongs to the Java Collections Framework.
*   **Key Properties:**
    *   It can only hold objects (it uses autoboxing for primitives).
    *   It is **synchronized**, which means it is thread-safe. This makes it slightly slower than its modern alternative, `ArrayList`, which is not synchronized. `ArrayList` is generally preferred in single-threaded applications.
*   **Analogy:** A shopping bag. You can keep adding items to it, and it will expand. You can also remove items, and it will shrink. You don't need to know the exact number of items beforehand.

**Program Example:**
```java
import java.util.Vector; // Must import the Vector class

public class VectorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Vector that can hold Strings
        Vector<String> shoppingList = new Vector<>();

        // Add elements
        shoppingList.add("Milk");
        shoppingList.add("Bread");
        shoppingList.add("Eggs");
        
        System.out.println("Initial Shopping List: " + shoppingList);
        
        // Remove an element
        shoppingList.remove("Bread");
        
        System.out.println("Updated List: " + shoppingList);
        System.out.println("Number of items to buy: " + shoppingList.size());
    }
}
```

## **Practice Worksheet: Java Fundamentals**

**Name:** ___________________________
**Roll No:** ___________________________

### **Instructions**
For each question, try to write the code yourself first. Then, compare your solution with the provided one and read the explanation to understand the key concepts involved.

---

### **Section A: Data Types, Casting, and Operators**

**❓ Q1. Temperature Converter**
Write a Java program that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
*   The formula is: `Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32`.
*   Declare a `double` variable for the Celsius temperature (e.g., `25.0`).
*   Calculate the Fahrenheit temperature. **Be careful with integer division (`9/5`)!**
*   Print the result in a user-friendly format, like "25.0°C is equal to 77.0°F".

**❓ Q2. Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle**
Write a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle.
*   Declare two `int` variables, `length` and `width`.
*   Calculate the area (`length * width`).
*   Calculate the perimeter (`2 * (length + width)`).
*   Print both results clearly.

**❓ Q3. Swapping Two Numbers**
Write a program to swap the values of two integer variables **without using a third temporary variable**.
*   Initialize two variables, `a` and `b`.
*   Use arithmetic operators to swap their values.
*   Print the values of `a` and `b` before and after the swap to verify the result.

---

### **Section B: Arrays, Strings, and `Vector`**

**❓ Q4. Array Operations: Find Max and Average**
Write a program that performs the following operations on an integer array:
1.  Declare and initialize an integer array with at least 5 numbers (e.g., `{10, 45, 23, 67, 12}`).
2.  Iterate through the array to find the **maximum value**.
3.  Calculate the **average** of all the elements in the array.
4.  Print the array, the maximum value, and the average.

**❓ Q5. String Manipulation: Palindrome Checker**
A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forwards and backward (e.g., "madam", "racecar"). Write a program that checks if a given `String` is a palindrome.
1.  Start with a given `String`, for example, `"level"`.
2.  Create a new, reversed version of the string. (Hint: You can loop through the original string backward and build the new one).
3.  Compare the original string with the reversed string (ignoring case) to determine if it's a palindrome.
4.  Print the result.

**❓ Q6. `Vector` Task List**
Write a simple to-do list application using a `Vector`.
1.  Create a `Vector` of `String` to hold your tasks.
2.  Add at least three tasks to the list (e.g., "Complete Java assignment", "Buy groceries", "Go for a run").
3.  Print the initial list of tasks.
4.  "Complete" a task by removing one of the items from the list.
5.  Print the final list and the total number of remaining tasks.

## **✅ Solutions and Explanations**

### **Solution A1: Temperature Converter**

#### **Code**
```java
public class TemperatureConverter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 1. Declare the initial temperature in Celsius
        double celsius = 25.0;

        // 2. Calculate Fahrenheit.
        // It's crucial to use 9.0/5.0 to ensure floating-point division.
        // If we used 9/5, Java would perform integer division and the result would be 1,
        // which would lead to a wrong answer.
        double fahrenheit = (celsius * 9.0 / 5.0) + 32;

        // 3. Print the result using printf for formatted output.
        // "%.1f" formats a floating-point number to one decimal place.
        System.out.printf("%.1f°C is equal to %.1f°F\n", celsius, fahrenheit);
    }
}
```
#### **Explanation**
*   **Key Concept:** This question tests understanding of data types (`double`) and operator precedence. The most important part is avoiding integer division. `9 / 5` would result in `1`, but `9.0 / 5.0` results in `1.8`, which is correct for the formula.
*   `printf` is used for formatted printing, which is cleaner than string concatenation for this kind of output. `%.1f` is a format specifier for a float/double with one decimal place.

---

### **Solution A2: Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle**
#### **Code**
```java
public class RectangleCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 1. Declare dimensions
        int length = 20;
        int width = 10;
        
        // 2. Calculate Area
        int area = length * width;
        
        // 3. Calculate Perimeter
        int perimeter = 2 * (length + width);
        
        // 4. Print the results
        System.out.println("For a rectangle with length " + length + " and width " + width + ":");
        System.out.println("The Area is: " + area);
        System.out.println("The Perimeter is: " + perimeter);
    }
}
```
#### **Explanation**
*   **Key Concept:** This is a straightforward application of arithmetic operators and variable declaration. It reinforces the use of parentheses `()` to control the order of operations, ensuring `length + width` is calculated before multiplying by `2`.

---

### **Solution A3: Swapping Two Numbers**
#### **Code**
```java
public class SwapNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;

        System.out.println("--- Before Swapping ---");
        System.out.println("a = " + a);
        System.out.println("b = " + b);
        
        // The swapping logic
        a = a + b; // a is now 30 (10 + 20)
        b = a - b; // b is now 10 (30 - 20)
        a = a - b; // a is now 20 (30 - 10)

        System.out.println("\n--- After Swapping ---");
        System.out.println("a = " + a);
        System.out.println("b = " + b);
    }
}
```
#### **Explanation**
*   **Key Concept:** This is a classic logic puzzle that demonstrates a deeper understanding of how variables and arithmetic operations work.
    1.  `a = a + b;`: We store the sum of both numbers in `a`. `a` temporarily holds the combined value.
    2.  `b = a - b;`: The new `a` (which is the sum) minus the original `b` gives us the original value of `a`. We store this in `b`. Now `b` has `a`'s original value.
    3.  `a = a - b;`: The new `a` (the sum) minus the new `b` (which is the original `a`) gives us the original value of `b`. We store this back in `a`. Now `a` has `b`'s original value. The swap is complete.

### **Solution B4: Array Operations: Find Max and Average**
#### **Code**
```java
import java.util.Arrays; // Useful utility for printing arrays

public class ArrayOperations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 1. Declare and initialize the array
        int[] numbers = {10, 45, 23, 67, 12};
        
        // 2. Find the maximum value
        int max = numbers[0]; // Assume the first element is the max initially
        double sum = 0;       // Use double for sum to get a precise average

        // 3. Iterate to find max and calculate sum
        for (int number : numbers) {
            if (number > max) {
                max = number; // Found a new maximum, update it
            }
            sum += number; // Add the current number to the sum
        }
        
        // 4. Calculate the average
        double average = sum / numbers.length;

        // 5. Print the results
        System.out.println("The array is: " + Arrays.toString(numbers));
        System.out.println("The maximum value is: " + max);
        System.out.printf("The average value is: %.2f\n", average);
    }
}
```
#### **Explanation**
*   **Key Concept:** This problem tests array iteration, conditional logic (`if`), and basic calculations.
*   **Initialization:** It's important to initialize `max` with the first element of the array, not `0`. If all numbers in the array were negative, initializing `max` to `0` would give the wrong result.
*   **Data Type for Average:** `sum` is declared as a `double` to ensure that when we divide by `numbers.length`, we perform floating-point division and get a precise average, not an integer-truncated one.
*   **`Arrays.toString()`:** This is a convenient built-in Java utility to get a nice, printable string representation of an array.

---

### **Solution B5: String Manipulation: Palindrome Checker**
#### **Code**
```java
public class PalindromeChecker {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String original = "Racecar";
        String reversed = "";

        // Loop through the original string from the last character to the first
        for (int i = original.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // Append each character to the 'reversed' string
            reversed = reversed + original.charAt(i);
        }

        System.out.println("Original String: " + original);
        System.out.println("Reversed String: " + reversed);

        // Compare the original and reversed strings, ignoring case differences
        if (original.equalsIgnoreCase(reversed)) {
            System.out.println("Result: The string is a palindrome.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Result: The string is NOT a palindrome.");
        }
    }
}
```
#### **Explanation**
*   **Key Concept:** This demonstrates string iteration and manipulation. It shows how to access individual characters of a string using `charAt(i)` and build a new string through concatenation (`+`).
*   **`length()` vs. Index:** Remember that `string.length()` gives the total count of characters, while the last character is at index `length() - 1`.
*   **`equalsIgnoreCase()`:** This is the correct method to use for case-insensitive comparison. Using `==` would compare object references (which would be false), and `equals()` would be case-sensitive (`"Racecar"` is not equal to `"racecaR"`).

### **Solution B6: `Vector` Task List**
#### **Code**
```java
import java.util.Vector;

public class TodoList {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 1. Create a Vector to hold String tasks
        Vector<String> tasks = new Vector<>();

        // 2. Add tasks
        tasks.add("Complete Java assignment");
        tasks.add("Buy groceries");
        tasks.add("Go for a run");

        // 3. Print the initial list
        System.out.println("--- Initial To-Do List ---");
        System.out.println("Total tasks: " + tasks.size());
        for (String task : tasks) {
            System.out.println("- " + task);
        }

        // 4. "Complete" a task by removing it
        System.out.println("\nCompleting 'Buy groceries'...");
        tasks.remove("Buy groceries");
        
        // 5. Print the final list
        System.out.println("\n--- Final To-Do List ---");
        System.out.println("Remaining tasks: " + tasks.size());
        for (String task : tasks) {
            System.out.println("- " + task);
        }
    }
}
```
#### **Explanation**
*   **Key Concept:** This demonstrates the basic usage of a `Vector`, a dynamic collection.
*   **`import` Statement:** You must import `java.util.Vector` to use it.
*   **Core Methods:** The example uses `add()` to insert elements, `size()` to get the current number of elements, and `remove()` to delete an element by its value. This highlights the dynamic nature of a `Vector` compared to a fixed-size array.
